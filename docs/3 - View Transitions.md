## Dev Log

https://github.com/nachog00/astro-blog-tuto/commit/9be6894bae2fc4a8822cf661ba00ae8ea9ddd323

added view transition router and tested out some transition:name generating methods
Right now I created a prop slugifier specifically for the Post collection. It takes charge of generating names specific for every post and prop.
-[ ] I should create more general typying and util funcitons. Maybe even directly export the slugified names with the Collection Items
